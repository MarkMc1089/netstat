`netstat` allows you to easily view which TCP ports are in use and which are free to use. 

Load library

```{r results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# library(devtools)
# install_github("stevecondylios/netstat")
library(netstat)
```

### See which TCP ports are *in use*

```{r}
ports_in_use()
```

### Find a free TCP port using `free_port()`.


```{r}
free_port()
free_port(random=T)
```

* `free_port()` returns a TCP port from Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) listed 
unassigned ports. 

* Any TCP port being used by the local machine will not be returned (so 
`free_port()` can be used to allocate a free port programmatically in applications without collisions)
