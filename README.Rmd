## The Netstat Package

The purpose of this package is the easily view which TCP ports are in use and which are free to use. 

Install and load the `netstat` library with

```{r results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# library(devtools)
# install_github("stevecondylios/netstat")
library(netstat)
```

See which TCP ports are in use

```{r}
# Display the TCP ports currently in use
ports_in_use()
```

Find a free TCP port using `free_port()`.

`free_port()` returns a TCP port from Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) listed 
unassigned ports. Any TCP port being used by the local machine will not be returned (so 
`free_port()` can be used for port allocation in applications)

```{r}
# Display the TCP ports currently in use
free_port()
free_port(random=T)
```
